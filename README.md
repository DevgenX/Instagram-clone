The Register and Login were built using device package. The device package provides a variety of built-in methods and helpers that handle user registration, login/logout, password management, email confirmation, and more.

Some of the specific things that I utilized device for :

- Implement user registration and authentication
- Customize the authentication flow and redirect behavior
- Use different authentication strategies (e.g., email or username)
- Restrict access to certain parts of the application based on user roles or permissions

### Create Post

Creating Post was designed using bootstrap and uses FilePond to let the preview happen.
